# The Role of Chromatic Stimuli in Modulating Perceptual Inpainting within the Visual Cortex

We employ a third party [pre-trained facial segmentation](https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch) model to integrate grids of varying sizes. These grids distinctly color the face and the background using only red and blue hues. By doing so, we aim to investigate how these chromatic stimuli, in conjunction with spatial elements like grid size, influence the brain's capacity for perceptual inpainting
